## Quick Start

### Database Seeding (NEW! ðŸŒ±)

Quickly populate your database with sample data for development or deployment:

```sh
npm run seed
```

This creates:
- 1 Residence (Sunset Villa)
- 1 Admin (username: `admin`, password: `admin123`)
- 5 Residents (password: `resident123`)
- 5 Vehicles
- 3 Guards (password: `guard123`)
- 2 Guest Passes

**Perfect for EC2 deployment - hit the ground running!** ðŸš€

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) and [EC2_DEPLOYMENT.md](EC2_DEPLOYMENT.md) for details.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
